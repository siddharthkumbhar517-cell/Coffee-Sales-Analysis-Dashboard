<H1>📚 Data Story</H1>
📉 Low-performing products include certain flavored variants, coffee beans, and merchandise.

🧥 Notably, merchandise clothing sales at the Hell's Kitchen store are significantly lower than other locations.

💡 Recommendations:
Introduce promotional offers to boost sales in that region.
Alternatively, consider removing such items from in-store displays and offering them as order-only to reduce operational costs.
