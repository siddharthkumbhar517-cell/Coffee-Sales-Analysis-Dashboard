📚 Data Story
📉 Low-performing products include certain flavored variants, coffee beans, and merchandise.
🧥 Notably, merchandise clothing sales at the Hell's Kitchen store are significantly lower than other locations.
💡 Recommendations:

Introduce promotional offers to boost sales in that region.
Alternatively, consider removing such items from in-store displays and offering them as order-only to reduce operational costs.
